### Overlap With Homework 5

For Homework 5, I used Altair inside a Jupyter notebook to create a state-level interactive bar chart. 
That assignment focused on filtering licenses by state for the Fall 2022 dataset.

In Homework 6, I used Streamlit to build two completely different visualizations:
1. A bar chart showing the top 20 cities by total license count.
2. An interactive trend line showing the number of issued licenses over time for each license type.

Although both assignments use the same dataset, the *visualizations, goals, and insights are different*.  
HW5 focused on **state-level geographic comparison**, while HW6 focuses on **city-level counts** and 
**yearly trends**. Therefore, there is **no direct overlap** between the HW5 and HW6 visualizations.
